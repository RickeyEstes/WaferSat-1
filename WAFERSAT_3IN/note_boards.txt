For changing pin functions, you should edit WAFERSAT_3IN/cfg/board.chcfg (or
equivalent) with the changes, then recompile using the fmpp tool (as supplied
with chibistudio). Change into the WAFERSAT_3IN/cfg folder and do:

	~/bin/ChibiStudio/tools/fmpp/bin/fmpp -C board.fmpp 

Adjusting appropriately for the path to ChibiStudio on your system. This will
write WAFERSAT_3IN/board.c, board.h and board.mk. Since the board.mk that gets
written assumes the folder is within the chibios boards folder,
boards_fixed.mk is provided with correct paths and won't be overwritten
autoamtically
